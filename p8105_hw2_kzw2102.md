# Problem 1

## Load in Mr. Trash Wheel dataset

  - Reads in the the dataset and specifically reads in the Mr. Trash
    Wheel Sheet
  - Omits non-data entries (rows with notes/figures; columns containing
    notes)
  - Uses function read\_excel
  - Uses Reasonable Variable names
  - Omit Rows that do not include dumpset-specific data
  - Round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts
    the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
library(readxl)

##just want the "Mr. Trash Wheel" sheet and clean the data from there
waterwheel_data=
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet="Mr. Trash Wheel", range="A2:N408"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls=as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits=0)) 
    ) %>%
  drop_na(dumpster)

view(waterwheel_data)
```

## Reading and Cleaning Precipitation data for 2017 and 2018

``` r
## reading and cleaning Precipitation data for 2017. Adding year 2018 and omitting rows without preciptiation data  
Precip_2018_data=
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet="2018 Precipitation", range="A2:B14"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year=2018) %>%
  filter(!is.na(total))

view(Precip_2018_data)
## reading and cleaning Precipitation data for 2018
Precip_2017_data=
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
    sheet="2017 Precipitation",
    range="A2:B14"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year=2017) %>%
  filter(!is.na(total))

view(Precip_2017_data)

#stacking/binding to combine the two datasets 
twoyear_precip_data=
  bind_rows(Precip_2018_data, Precip_2017_data) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]
  )
view(twoyear_precip_data)
```

  - median number of sports balls in dumpster 2017

In the Mr. Trash Wheel data, multiple information was taken. For
example, the number of dumpsters that were filled per month, how much
each dumpster weighed (in tons), what was in each dumpster, etc. It was
found that between May 2014 and July 2018, a total of 344 dumpsters were
collected. An example of an item that was found in each dumpster was
sports balls. In the year 2017, the median number of sports balls in
dumpster was 8

It should also be noted that the amount of trash the device receives is
highly dependent of rainfall. Dumpsters fill much faster when it rains
than when it doesn’t. Between 2017 and 2018, a total of 24 months were
collected. That being said, the total precipitation in 2017 was 32.93
and the total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33.

The following datasets include rate of unemployment per specific months
of a specific year, data on the number of natioanl politicians who were
either democratic or republican within a given time, and information
related to the stock market index (S\&P). These three data sets were
combined based off of the year and month, and were joined via left-join
feature. The resulting data contains 1644 rows and 13 columns. The
resulting data set contains years between 1947 and 2015.

# Problem 3

  - tidy data
  - made sure categorical predictors are consistent
  - makes sure all the case structures are the same (changed to all
    caps)
  - remove duplicated items
